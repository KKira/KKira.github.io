			<p>How good can I become at using Unity? Hopefully these tutorials will give me the answer.

			There are two aspects I am exploring here. How can I make these entries journal-like? The other is the organization of my folder structures for the upcoming tutorials. As I am also attempting to give each of these tutorials some sort of unique use, I lose time figuring out the most boring part of this endeavour:

			Management. But, better have it properly structured now, than losing even more time later on.<br><br>

			So chop...<img src="static/images/management.png"> chop.<br><br>

			As the creeping realization that management might not be my strongest suit, I look over the title of the tutorial: "Game Objects and Scripts", and it involves making a clock. Simple enough.<br><br>

			<img src="static/images/objectives.png"><br><br>

			The most boring variation I can think of for this tutorial is to make it into a game of stopping the clock at a certain time interval. After what feels an eternity, I manage some sort of project structure. How I miss having two monitors. Things to note while building a clock:<br><br>

			<ul class="notes">
			<li>Child objects are subject to the transformation of their parent object.<br></li>
			<li>Create different materials to make the assets distinct.<br></li>
			<li>An object's orientation is relative to its own local origin (position).<br></li>
			<li>Using the object's hierarchy to figure out positions around the scene.<br></li>
			<li>What is a class? - Defines what data objects can contain and what functionality they have.<br></li>
			<li>Classes can define data and functionality that do not belong to objects, but to the class itself. Used to provide globally-available functionality.<br></li>
			<li>Default access modifier for classes? - "internal class Clock", which restricts access to the code from the same assembly. Relevant when using packaged code in multiple DLL files.<br></li>
			<li>What does mono-behavior mean? - When missing, we cannot use the script to create a component in Unity. Unity can only use subtypes of MonoBehaviour to create components. The idea is that we can program our own components to add custom behavior to game objects.<br></li>
			<li>Doesn't Awake have to be public? - Awake and other methods are special to Unity. It will find them and invoke them when appropriate.<br></li>
			<li>What is a property? - It is a method that pretends to be a field. Might be read/write-only.<br></li>
			<li>What is a structure? - A blueprint like a class. Instead it is a simple value like an integer or color instead of an object. It has no sense of identity. Use struct.<br></li>
			<li>What is a quaternion? - Based on complex numbers to represent 3D rotations. Do not suffer from gimbal lock.<br></li>
			<li>What's special about constants? - const keywords indicates that a value will never change and does not need to be a field. Its value is computed during compilation and is subsituted for all usage of the constant. Only possible for primitive types like numbers.<br></li>
			<li>What's local about the rotation? - Refers to the actual rotation of a transform component, independent of its parents. Rotation in the object's local space.<br></li>
			<li>What's a variable? - Acts like a filed, except it exists only while a method is being executed. It belongs to the method not the class.<br></li>
			<li>Is single precision enough? - For most games, yes. Becomes a problem when working with very large distances or scale differences.<br><br></li>
			</ul>

			Aaaand...we are done with the tutorial. Quick refresher, this entry turned out to have a lot of "important notes" which made it less like a journal. For the variation on this tutorial, I will make an obstacle like course. Where the player needs to avoid the hands of the clock as time speeds up! Until next time!</p>
